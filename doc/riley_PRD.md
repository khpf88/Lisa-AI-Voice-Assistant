# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Riley AI Intelligence & Memory Module

## 1. Introduction

Riley is designed as a core intelligence and memory module that enhances the capabilities of a primary AI voice assistant (e.g., Lisa). Instead of handling direct voice input or output, Riley focuses on advanced natural language processing, memory management, and intelligent response generation based on conversational context. This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for Riley in its role as an intelligent backend for a voice-first AI system.

## 2. Vision and Goals

**Vision:** To empower AI voice assistants with sophisticated memory, contextual understanding, and adaptive intelligence, fostering more natural, personalized, and meaningful human-computer interactions.

**Goals:**

*   Develop a robust and scalable architecture for a dedicated AI intelligence and memory module.
*   Integrate diverse memory storage mechanisms (short-term, long-term, emotional context).
*   Enable context-aware and memory-driven response generation.
*   Ensure the use of open-source and free technologies where feasible.
*   Provide comprehensive documentation for integration with other AI assistant components.

## 3. Functional Requirements

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| F-001 | Text Input Processing | The system shall accept transcribed text input from the primary voice assistant (e.g., Lisa). |
| F-002 | Natural Language Understanding (NLU) | The system shall process the input text to understand user intent, extract entities, and identify conversational context. |
| F-003 | Short-Term Memory Management | The system shall store and manage recent conversational turns to maintain context within a session. |
| F-004 | Long-Term Memory Storage & Retrieval | The system shall store and retrieve persistent information (facts, preferences, past interactions) in a structured database. |
| F-005 | Emotional Context Analysis | The system shall analyze the emotional tone or sentiment of the input text to inform response generation. |
| F-006 | Memory-Aware Response Generation | The system shall generate relevant and context-aware text responses, leveraging both short-term and long-term memory. |
| F-007 | Output Text Delivery | The system shall deliver the generated text response back to the primary voice assistant for utterance. |
| F-008 | Extensible API | The system shall expose a well-documented API for integration with primary voice assistants and other modules. |

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID | Requirement Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| NF-001 | Performance | The system shall process requests with low latency to support real-time conversational interaction. |
| NF-002 | Scalability | The system shall be designed to handle a growing volume of requests and memory data. |
| NF-003 | Reliability | The system shall be highly available and resilient to failures, especially concerning memory persistence. |
| NF-004 | Security | All stored memory data and communication shall be secured and encrypted. |
| NF-005 | Usability | The system's API shall be intuitive and well-documented for easy integration. |
| NF-006 | Open Source | All components of the system shall be open-source and free to use where feasible. |

## 5. Future Enhancements

*   **Advanced Reasoning:** Implement more complex reasoning capabilities based on integrated knowledge graphs or logical inference.
*   **Personalization Engine:** Develop deeper personalization based on user behavior patterns and long-term memory analysis.
*   **Multi-modal Memory:** Integrate memory from other modalities (e.g., visual, environmental sensors).
*   **Self-Learning Memory:** Implement mechanisms for Riley to autonomously update and refine its memory based on new interactions.
*   **Integration with external knowledge bases:** Connect to external APIs for real-time information retrieval.
