# Architecture - Riley AI Intelligence & Memory Module

## Current Proposed Architecture (MVP)

The initial architecture for the Riley AI Intelligence & Memory Module is designed to be simple, modular, and scalable, focusing on enhancing a primary voice assistant (e.g., Lisa) through a central Orchestration Service.

    subgraph Core AI Services
        A[Orchestration Service] --> B(Riley AI Intelligence & Memory Module);
        B --> C[Memory Databases];
    end

    subgraph Riley AI Intelligence & Memory Module
        B --> D[Natural Language Understanding (NLU)];
        B --> E[Memory Management];
        B --> F[Response Generation];
        D --> B;
        E --> B;
        F --> B;
    end

    subgraph External Interactions
        A -- "Text/Context" --> B;
        B -- "Intelligent Response" --> A;
    end
```

**Components:**

*   **Orchestration Service:** The central component that coordinates interactions between various AI modules. It sends transcribed text and context to Riley and receives intelligent responses back.
*   **Riley AI Intelligence & Memory Module:** This module is responsible for:
    *   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Processes incoming text to understand user intent and extract key information.
    *   **Memory Management:** Handles storing and retrieving information from various memory systems (short-term, long-term, emotional context).
    *   **Response Generation:** Creates intelligent, memory-aware text responses based on processed input and retrieved memories.
    *   **Memory Databases:** External databases used by Riley for persistent storage of conversational context, user profiles, and long-term knowledge.

## Future Architecture

The future architecture will focus on further enhancing Riley's intelligence and scalability within the broader AI assistant ecosystem, interacting primarily with the Orchestration Service.

*   **Microservices Architecture:** Riley's components (NLU, Memory, Response Generation) will be deployed as separate microservices, allowing for independent scaling and development.
*   **API Gateway:** An API gateway will manage and secure the communication between the Orchestration Service and Riley's microservices.
*   **Message Queue:** A message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) will be used to enable asynchronous communication between the Orchestration Service and Riley, improving reliability and performance.
*   **Machine Learning Pipeline:** A dedicated machine learning pipeline will be established for training and deploying new models for NLU, memory management, and response generation within Riley.
*   **Data Lake:** A data lake will be created to store and analyze user interaction data, which will be used to improve Riley's memory and personalization capabilities.
*   **Advanced Memory Systems:** Exploration of knowledge graphs, semantic memory networks, and other advanced memory structures within Riley.
